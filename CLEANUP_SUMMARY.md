## Code Quality Improvements

## Impact
- **Repository Size**: Reduced by removing unnecessary test and log files
- **Code Quality**: Improved by removing dead code and test artifacts
- **Maintainability**: Enhanced with better .gitignore patterns

## Recommendations
1. Run tests to ensure nothing critical was removed
2. Consider moving legitimate test files to a proper test directory structure
3. Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent test files from being committed
4. Configure CI/CD to handle test file generation properly

## Files Preserved
All production code, documentation, and legitimate test files in the proper test directories have been preserved.
