# Pyodide Package Loading Solution

## Current Behavior
When Open WebUI starts, Pyodide downloads Python packages from CDN every time, showing messages like:
```
Package distro-1.9.0-py3-none-any.whl loaded from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.27.7/full/, caching the wheel in node_modules for future use.
```

## Why This Happens
1. Pyodide is the Python interpreter that runs in the browser for the code execution feature
2. It needs various Python packages (distro, httpx, pydantic, openai, etc.) for functionality
3. While Pyodide core is loaded from `/static/pyodide/`, additional packages are fetched from CDN when needed
4. The browser cache isn't persisting these packages between sessions

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Pre-download All Required Packages (Recommended)
Add all required packages to your `/static/pyodide/` directory:

```bash
# Download additional packages that are being fetched from CDN
cd static/pyodide
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.27.7/full/distro-1.9.0-py3-none-any.whl
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.27.7/full/httpx-0.27.0-py3-none-any.whl
# ... download other packages shown in console
```

### Option 2: Enable Browser Caching
Configure your web server to set proper cache headers for Pyodide assets:

```nginx
# For nginx
location /pyodide/ {
    expires 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```

### Option 3: Use Service Worker Caching
Implement a service worker to cache Pyodide packages:

```javascript
// In service worker
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('pyodide') || event.request.url.includes('.whl')) {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
        return response || fetch(event.request).then((response) => {
          return caches.open('pyodide-cache').then((cache) => {
            cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
            return response;
          });
        });
      })
    );
  }
});
```

### Option 4: Disable Code Execution (If Not Needed)
If you don't use the code execution feature, you can disable it in Settings > Code Execution to avoid loading Pyodide entirely.

## Verification
After implementing a solution, you should see:
- No CDN downloads on subsequent page loads
- Faster startup times
- Packages loaded from cache or local storage

## Note
This behavior is normal and doesn't affect functionality - it's just a performance optimization opportunity.
