# YouTube Manual Conversion Implementation

## Overview
This implementation modifies the YouTube preview functionality in Open WebUI to only convert YouTube URLs to video previews AFTER the enhance button is clicked, not automatically when pasting/typing the link. This ensures that the enhance function can still extract and process YouTube URLs from plain text.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Manual YouTube Extension (`youtube-manual.ts`)
- Created a new version of the YouTube extension that removes automatic URL conversion
- Removed `addPasteRules()` and `addInputRules()` to prevent automatic conversion
- Added a new command `convertYoutubeUrls()` to manually trigger URL conversion
- Maintains all existing functionality (thumbnails, lazy loading, responsive design)

### 2. Modified Files

#### `/src/lib/components/common/RichTextInput/Youtube/index.ts`
- Updated to use `YoutubeManual` instead of the automatic `Youtube` extension
- Original file backed up as `index-original.ts`

#### `/src/lib/components/notes/NoteEditor.svelte`
- Added YouTube URL conversion after enhance completion
- Calls `editor.commands.convertYoutubeUrls()` after streaming is done
- This ensures URLs are converted to videos after enhancement

#### `/src/lib/components/notes/NoteEditor/Controls.svelte`
- Added a manual "Convert YouTube URLs to Videos" button
- Allows users to convert URLs without using the enhance feature
- Button is disabled when editor is not available

## How It Works

### Before Enhancement
1. User pastes/types YouTube URLs in the editor
2. URLs remain as plain text (not converted to videos)
3. The enhance function can extract these URLs for processing

### During Enhancement
1. User clicks the enhance button
2. `extractYoutubeUrlsFromText` successfully extracts YouTube URLs from plain text
3. YouTube transcripts are fetched and used in the enhancement process
4. Enhanced content is streamed back to the editor

### After Enhancement
1. Once streaming is complete, `convertYoutubeUrls()` is automatically called
2. All YouTube URLs in the document are converted to video embeds
3. Videos appear with thumbnails and play buttons as before

### Manual Conversion Option
- Users can also use the "Convert YouTube URLs to Videos" button in the Controls panel
- This allows conversion without going through the enhance process
- Useful for users who just want to embed videos without enhancement

## Benefits
1. **Preserves URLs for Enhancement**: YouTube URLs remain extractable by the enhance function
2. **Automatic Conversion After Enhancement**: URLs are still converted to videos, just at the right time
3. **Manual Control**: Users have explicit control over when URLs become videos
4. **Backward Compatible**: All existing YouTube preview features work the same way

## Testing
Use the `test-youtube-manual.md` file to verify:
1. YouTube URLs are NOT automatically converted when pasted
2. Enhance function can extract YouTube URLs
3. URLs are converted to videos after enhancement
4. Manual conversion button works correctly
5. All video preview features (thumbnail, play button, etc.) work as expected

## Future Considerations
1. Could add a setting to toggle between automatic and manual conversion modes
2. Could show a visual indicator when URLs are ready to be converted
3. Could add keyboard shortcuts for manual conversion
4. Could preserve some URLs as text while converting others
